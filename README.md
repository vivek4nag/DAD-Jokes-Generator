## 📜 Disclaimer

This app is designed for lighthearted fun and entertainment purposes. While I have made an effort to keep the jokes within a friendly range, humor is subjective, and not every joke may be to everyone’s taste. Some jokes may include dark humor, so **viewer discretion is advised**. Laugh responsibly!
